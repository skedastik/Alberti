FAR FUTURE

As it is, Alberti is a capable drafting tool, but could be augmented with the
following features to form a very powerful tool set:

   - Allow the user to select a number of shapes and duplicate them around a 
     chosen point by specified degrees in real-time.

Shape Labels
   - Text labels attached to shapes.
