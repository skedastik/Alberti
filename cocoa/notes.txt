THE "Crusty" PARADIGM

Take a program predominantly written in Javascript and SVG, and wrap it in a
Cocoa interface? Dare I? It's like Cocoa-crusted Javascript (hence "Crusty") and 
it's probably every bit as appealing as the name sounds.

A run-script build phase copies the necessary Javascript/XHTML resources to the 
Xcode project's "Web" group. These files are bundled with the build target.

A WebView serves as a host for the Javascript environment and facilitates 
communication with the Cocoa environment. I expect things to get ugly when 
attempting to fit this approach to Cocoa's document-based application structure.
Also, using the Javascript environment as a data source for various Cocoa data 
views and controls is going to be grotesque.
