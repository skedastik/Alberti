As of 7/2/2011, Alberti has only been tested in the following environments:

OS X
- Firefox 5
- Safari 5.0.5 (WebKit Nightly r89772)

UNSUPPORTED ENVIRONMENTS

Safari 5.0.5 does not support the HTML5 File API. As such, you must download
the latest WebKit nightly to run Alberti under Safari.

Alberti does not support Internet Explorer or Opera, and is known to have 
event-handling issues in Firefox under Windows.
