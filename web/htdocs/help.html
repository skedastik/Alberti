			<h2 id="nav_intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Alberti is a browser-based perspective drawing and layout application,
				named after Leon Battista Alberti, who quantified modern perspective drawing in his 
				treatise "Della Pittura".
			</p>
			<h3>Why is Alberti needed?</h3>
			<p>
				Undertaking a complex, accurate perspective drawing requires an enormous 
				amount of physical space. Depending on the requirements of the drawing, a 
				14x17 in. layout might require a drafting table 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep. 
				Furthermore, you would need a number of impractically large tools: a 
				straight-edge, a drafting triangle, possibly a compass fashioned out of a peg 
				and string.
			</p>
			<p>In short, it makes perfect sense to do this in software.</p>
			<p>
				Then why not use an existing solution like AutoCAD or 3ds Max? Because these 
				tools are overkill. Alberti provides a streamlined interface tailored 
				specifically to rapid, natural perspective drawing.
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_workspace">The Workspace</h2>
			<p>
				When Alberti is first loaded, you will see an empty workspace. This is the
				canvas on which shapes are drawn. An 'X' marks the center of the workspace, 
				which spans infinitely in all directions.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/c_hud.png"/>
			<p class="caption">Fig. 1. The workspace center.</p>
			<h3 id="nav_ws_nav">Navigating the Workspace</h3>
			<h4 id="nav_zap">Zooming and Panning</h4>
			<p>
				Panning is the act of translating, or changing, the horizontal or vertical position of the workspace. To
				pan, hold down either the <b>alt</b> or <b>E</b> key. While holding down either 
				key, click and drag to pan the workspace.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zooming is the act of moving closer to or away from the workspace. To zoom in, scroll 
				the mousewheel up. To zoom out, scroll down. Zooming occurs relative to the position 
				of the mouse cursor; in other words, the point under the mouse
				remains stationary during a zoom, while other points move away from or converge
				toward the mouse depending on whether you are zooming in or out.
			</p>
			<h4 id="nav_navbar">The Navigation Bar</h4>
			<p>
				Hovering at the top of the workspace is the navigation bar. The buttons here allow you to rapidly pan around
				the workspace.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/navbar.png"/>
			<p class="caption">Fig. 2. The navigation bar.</p>
			<p>The home button (<img class="insert" src="images/center_cam.png"/>) centers the workspace in the browser window.</p>
			<p>
				The other two buttons involve what are called <em>markers</em>. Markers can be placed anywhere in the workspace using
				the <a href="#nav_mark_tool">marker tool</a>. The left button (<img class="insert" src="images/next_vp.png"/>) pans
				to the next marker, the right button (<img class="insert" src="images/prev_vp.png"/>), the previous marker (hotkeys 
				<b>space</b> and <b>shift-space</b> respectively). As you cycle
				through markers, Alberti will also remember and pan to the last <em>manually-panned</em> position in the workspace.
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_tools">Tools</h2>
			<p>
				Hovering at the left side of the workspace is the tool bar. To select a tool, click on it.
				Most tools have hotkeys that allow you to select them with the keyboard. Hovering the mouse over a tool displays
				its name and associated hotkey in brackets.
				<img src="images/help/toolbar.png"/>
				<p class="caption">
					Fig. 3. The tool bar. Tools from top to bottom: Selection Tool, Line Tool, Arc Tool, Perspective Arc Tool, 
					Bezier Tool, Marker Tool. The selection tool is selected.
				</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				Each tool is capable of performing an action or drawing a shape based on a series of steps (usually involving a mouse
				click). The number of steps involved varies from tool to
				tool, several of them having optional steps.
			</p>
			<p>
				All tools follow the same convention: the optional steps can be skipped
				by either pressing <b>enter</b>/<b>return</b>, or by <b>right-clicking</b> (which is equivalent to a 
				left-click followed by enter/return). This is referred to as <em>completing</em>
				the tool. You may revert to a previous step at any time prior to completing a tool by pressing the <b>escape</b> key. 
				Each tool is discussed in detail below with optional steps indicated by faded step numbers.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_line_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/line_tool_btn.png"/>Line Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The line tool draws lines aligned to points. It can be thought of as a straightedge.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click anywhere in the workspace to define a reference point.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to define a second reference point. The line will be drawn along the resulting path.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to place the beginning of your line.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to place the end of your line and complete the tool.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				During step 2, the <b>shift</b> key may be held down to constrain the line to angles of 45&deg;.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_arc_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/carc_tool_btn.png"/>Arc Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The arc tool draws circles and circular arcs. It can be thought of as a compass.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click anywhere in the workspace to place the center of the circular arc.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click elsewhere to set the radius of the arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to begin sweeping an arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click elsewhere to complete the arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Repeat steps 3-4 as desired, or press enter or right-click to complete the tool.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				During step 2, the <b>shift</b> key may be held down in order to match the last-used arc radius. This is crucial for
				many <a href="#nav_construction">geometric constructions</a>.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_parc_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/persp_arc_tool_btn.png"/>Perspective Arc Tool</h3>
			<p>
					The perspective arc tool draws arcs in perspective, thereby producing ellipses or elliptical arcs. This is
					useful for constructing arches, circular windows, etc. in perspective. When approaching such a problem
					by hand, one generally starts with a rectangle in perspective and then inscribes the ellipse in that 
					rectangle. The perspective arc tool operates on the same principle.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/inscribe.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 4. An ellipse projected in perspective.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click to place the first "corner" of the perspective projection.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the second corner.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the third corner.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the fourth corner. This creates the projected ellipse.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to begin sweeping an arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click elsewhere to complete the arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Repeat steps 5-6 as desired, or press enter or right-click to complete the tool.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In order to accurately place the corners of the ellipse projection, use Alberti's <a href="#nav_snap">snap points</a> feature.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_bez_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/bez_tool_btn.png"/>Bezier Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The bezier tool allows you to draw arbitrary curves. It can be thought of as a French curve.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click to place the beginning of the curve.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the end of the curve.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the control point of the curve. This completes the curve.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				It is possible to accurately construct a curve in perspective by using <a href="#nav_snap">snapping</a> to place
				its control points.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/lancet.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 5. The ogive of a lancet window is constructed by placing the control points of its constituent curves at the 
				intersections of appropriate vanishing lines.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_sel_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/select_tool_btn.png"/>Selection Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The selection tool selects shapes. Once a shape is selected, it can be deleted by pressing <b>backspace</b> or
				<b>delete</b>, or by selecting <em>Edit > Delete</em> from the <a href="#nav_mm">main menu</a>. You can also
				<a href="#nav_cut_paste">cut</a> the shape by selecting <em>Edit > Cut</em>. Selections are indicated by
				dashed lines and black endpoint markers.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/selection.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 6. An unselected shape (left)<br/>and a selected one (right).
			</p>
			<p>
				In Alberti, once a shape is created it cannot be modified, even when selected. This is admittedly unusual for a
				vector-based drawing program, but is by design. The idea is that each shape is like a mark made by a pencil;
				it can be erased, but not changed.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click and hold the mouse button down.</p></li>
				<li><p>Drag the mouse to expand the selection box.</p></li>
				<li><p>Release the mouse button. Any shapes enclosed by or intersecting with the selection box will be selected.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				To add shapes to or remove shapes from an existing selection, simply hold down <b>shift</b> as you release the 
				mouse button 
				in step 3. Selected shapes within the selection box will be deselected while unselected shapes will become selected.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is possible to "pick" single shapes by simply clicking on a shape without dragging. You can also pick
				intersections using <a href="#nav_snap">snapping</a>. All shapes that intersect at the snap point will be
				selected.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_mark_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/marker_tool_btn.png"/>Marker Tool</h3>
			<p>
				Use the marker tool to place markers around the workspace. Markers are best placed at landmarks that you often
				frequent, such as vanishing points.
				<h4>Steps</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><p>Click anywhere in the workspace to place a marker.</p></li>
					<li><p>Cycle between markers at any time using the <a href="#nav_navbar">navigation bar</a> or associated hotkeys.</p></li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_snap">Snap Points</h2>
			<p>
				Snap points bring precision to the drawing process by automatically detecting potential snap points (e.g. intersections
				and tangencies). It is enabled by pressing and holding down the <b>D</b> key. When the tool crosshair is held near
				a snap point, a red, circular snap indicator appears at the snap point, and the tool "snaps" to this point. Use cases 
				are discussed below.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_isect">Intersections</h3>
			<p>
				Alberti will detect intersections between a line and any shape, as well as intersections between <a href="#nav_arc_tool">
				circular arcs</a>.
			</p>
			<div id="isect_demo" class="divimg"></div>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 7. Move the mouse over the image to see intersection detection in action with the line tool.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_tan">Tangency</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, Alberti detects only one type of tangency: that between a line and a <a href="#nav_parc_tool">
				perspective arc</a>. This is useful for precisely finding the edge of a rounded form in perspective.
			</p>
			<div id="tan_earc_demo" class="divimg"></div>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 8. Move the mouse over the image to see tangency detection involving the line tool and a perspective arc.
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_lp">Layers</h2>
			<p>
				Hovering at the right side of the workspace is the layer panel. Layers serve to organize shapes into groups; for
				instance, if you were drawing a building, you might use one layer for the floor plan, and another for the building 
				itself.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/layer_panel.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 9. The layer panel with two layers.
			</p>
			<p>
				In figure 9 above, the layer named "Building" is currently selected. To select a layer, simply click on it, or use the 
				<b>up-arrow</b> and <b>down-arrow</b> keys to cycle through them. Shapes are always drawn into the currently selected
				layer.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use the textured 
				(<img id="lpc_icon" class="insert" src="images/lpcollapse_on.png"/>)
				button at the bottom of the layer panel, or the <b>backslash</b> 
				(\) key to collapse and expand the layer panel.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/layer_panel_col.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 10. The layer panel in its collapsed state.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_hs_layers">Hiding and Showing Layers</h3>
			<p>
				The contents of a layer can be hidden by clicking its eye (<img class="insert3" src="images/vistog.png"/>) icon.
				A hidden layer cannot be selected and is therefore grayed out. At least one layer must remain visible at all times.
				To show a layer, click the space where its eye icon once resided (<img class="insert3" src="images/vistog_on.png"/>).
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_cd_layers">Creating and Deleting Layers</h3>
			<p>
				Use the (<img class="insert2" src="images/addlayer.png"/>) button at the bottom of the layer panel to create a new
				layer. Use the (<img class="insert2" src="images/remlayer.png"/>) button to delete the current layer. At least one
				visible layer must exist at all times.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_name_layers">Naming Layers</h3>
			<p>
				To change a layer's name, double-click on it. Hit <b>enter</b> to finalize the name change, or <b>escape</b> if you
				decide not to change it after all.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_order_layers">Changing Layer Order</h3>
			<p>
				To change the order of a layer, simply drag it to the desired position below or above another layer. During the drag
				operation, a white arrow indicates where the layer will be inserted.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_cc_layers">Color-Coding Layers</h3>
			<p>
				Layers are color-coded to aid with organization and clarity. A layer's color determines the stroke color of its shapes.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/layer_color.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 11. Color-coded layers and their shapes.
			</p>
			<p>
				To change a layer's color, click on its circular color well. A color picker will
				appear allowing you to select a color. Click outside the picker or press <b>enter</b> to finalize the color, or
				press <b>escape</b> to cancel.
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_mm">The Main Menu</h2>
			<p>
				Hovering at the top of the workspace is the main menu bar, much like one you would find in a desktop application.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/mm.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 12. The main menu.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_file">File</h3>
			<p>
				The file menu allows you to create, import, and export Alberti documents. Alberti documents use the 
				SVG format which is understood by a wide variety of illustration programs.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/file_menu.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 13. The file menu.
			</p>
			<h4 id="nav_save">Saving Files</h4>
			<p>
				For security reasons, your browser will not allow Alberti to save files directly to your hard drive. Because of
				this, several steps are involved in saving a file:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Select <em>Save as...</em> from Alberti's file menu. Alberti will open a new browser window containing the raw data of the document.</p></li>
				<li><p>Use your <em>browser's</em> file menu to save the file to your hard drive. Many browsers allow you to save files in several formats. <em>Make sure you select the option to save the complete web page source only!</em> Otherwise Alberti will not be able to import the resulting file.</p></li>
				<li><p>Close the window and resume working.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The default file name for documents is "Alberti Document". Chances are you will use a different name.
				However, due to browser limitations, Alberti is not able detect the name of the saved file. This means that every 
				time you save, you will have to rename the file from "Alberti Document" to the unique name. To work around this,
				you can save the file and immediately open it as described below.
			</p>
			<h4 id="nav_open">Opening Files</h4>
			<p>
				Select <em>Open...</em> from Alberti's file menu. A standard file dialog box will appear allowing you to select a file
				previously saved with Alberti. Assuming that the file was saved correctly, the document will load and appear in
				the workspace.
			</p>
			<p>
				After opening a document, Alberti will be able to read its file name and use it in 
				subsequent <em>Save As...</em> operations.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_edit">Edit</h3>
			<img src="images/help/edit_menu.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 14. The edit menu.
			</p>
			<h4 id="nav_undo_redo">Undo and Redo</h4>
			<p>
				Most actions in Alberti are undo-able. Select <em>Undo</em> to undo an action such as deleting a shape or layer,
				and <em>redo</em> if you change your mind. Alberti will remember the last hundred actions performed.
			</p>
			<h4 id="nav_cut_paste">Cut and Paste</h4>
			<p>
				Select any number of shapes and choose <em>Cut</em> to transfer the shapes from the workspace to Alberti's
				internal clipboard. These shapes can then be pasted into another layer or document.
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_underlays">Underlays</h2>
			<p>
				Generally, one doesn't compose an image using perspective construction directly. It makes more sense to create
				a sketch and use the principles of perspective to "square" the drawing (correct for perspective errors, check the
				relative scale of objects in the image, etc.). To this end, Alberti is able to import
				<em>underlays</em>&#8212;images placed under the Alberti workspace that serve as a reference for construction.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_import">Importing</h3>
			<p>
				Use the underlay menu at the top of the Alberti workspace to import underlays.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/ul_menu.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 15. The underlay menu.
			</p>
			<p>
				Select <em>Import Underlay...</em> to choose an image file from your hard drive to use as an underlay. Once 
				imported, the underlay can be removed using <em>Remove Underlay</em>.
			</p>
			<p class="note">
				Underlays require a lot of processing power and are best suited to browsers featuring hardware
				acceleration. Performance may be sluggish otherwise.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_opacity">Opacity</h3>
			<p>
				After importing an underlay, you can adjust its opacity with the opacity slider that appears next to the underlay
				menu.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/ul_opacity.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 16. The underlay opacity slider.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the slider at its rightmost position, the underlay becomes fully opaque; at its leftmost position, the
				underlay is hidden altogether.

			<h2 id="nav_rsrc">Resources</h2>
			<p>
				Alberti has a relatively low-tech tool set, reflecting drafting tools that have been in use since
				the Renaissance. In time, this tool set will grow. To get the most out of its existing features, you
				should have a basic familiarity with geometric construction and perspective.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_construction">Geometric Construction</h3>
			<p>
				Geometric construction refers to the use of a ruler and compass (in Alberti's case, the
				<a href="#nav_line_tool">line tool</a> and <a href="#nav_arc_tool">arc tool</a>) to construct various shapes.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/geo_con.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				Fig. 17. Perpendicular and parallel line constructions via the line and arc tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				Understanding how to perform a handful of these basic constructions is enough to handle nearly everything
				related to the process of perspective drawing.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/tocs/constructionstoc.html" target="_blank">Math Open Reference</a>

			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_perspective">Perspective</h3>
			<p>
				There is endless material on perspective drawing available throughout the internet. A good place to go if
				you're looking for depth is Bruce MacEvoy's
				<a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/tech10.html#index" target="_blank">massive treatise</a> on the subject.
				Every aspect of perspective drawing is covered
				from first principles to shadow constructions.
