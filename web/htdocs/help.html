			<h2 id="nav_intro">Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Alberti is a browser-based perspective drawing and layout application,
				named after Leon Battista Alberti, who quantified modern perspective drawing in his 
				treatise "Della Pittura".
			</p>
			<h3>Why is Alberti needed?</h3>
			<p>
				Undertaking a complex, accurate perspective drawing requires an enormous 
				amount of physical space. Depending on the requirements of the drawing, a 
				14x17 in. layout might require a drafting table 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep. 
				Furthermore, you would need a number of impractically large tools: a 
				straight-edge, a drafting triangle, possibly a compass fashioned out of a peg 
				and string.
			</p>
			<p>In short, it makes perfect sense to do this in software.</p>
			<p>
				Then why not use an existing solution like AutoCAD or 3ds Max? Because these 
				tools are overkill. Alberti provides a streamlined interface tailored 
				specifically to rapid, natural perspective drawing.
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_workspace">The Workspace</h2>
			<p>
				When Alberti is first loaded, you will see an empty workspace. This is the
				canvas on which shapes are drawn. An 'X' marks the center of the workspace, 
				which spans infinitely in all directions.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/c_hud.png"/>
			<p class="caption">The workspace center.</p>
			<h3 id="nav_ws_nav">Navigating the Workspace</h3>
			<h4 id="nav_zap">Zooming and Panning</h4>
			<p>
				Panning is the act of translating, or changing, the horizontal or vertical position of the workspace. To
				pan, hold down either the <b>alt</b> or <b>E</b> key. While holding down either 
				key, click and drag to pan the workspace.
			</p>
			<p>
				Zooming is the act of moving closer to or away from the workspace. To zoom in, scroll 
				the mousewheel up. To zoom out, scroll down. Zooming occurs relative to the position 
				of the mouse cursor; in other words, the point under the mouse
				remains stationary during a zoom, while other points move away from or converge
				toward the mouse depending on whether you are zooming in or out.
			</p>
			<h4 id="nav_navbar">The Navigation Bar</h4>
			<p>
				Hovering at the top of the workspace is the navigation bar. The buttons here allow you to rapidly pan around
				the workspace.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/navbar.png"/>
			<p class="caption">The navigation bar.</p>
			<p>The home button (<img class="insert" src="images/center_cam.png"/>) centers the workspace in the browser window.</p>
			<p>
				The other two buttons involve what are called <em>markers</em>. Markers can be placed anywhere in the workspace using
				the <a href="#nav_mark_tool">marker tool</a>. The left button (<img class="insert" src="images/next_vp.png"/>) pans
				to the next marker, the right button (<img class="insert" src="images/prev_vp.png"/>), the previous marker (hotkeys 
				<b>space</b> and <b>shift-space</b> respectively). As you cycle
				through markers, Alberti will also remember and pan to the last <em>manually-panned</em> position in the workspace.
			</p>
			<h2 id="nav_tools">Tools</h2>
			<p>
				Hovering at the left side of the workspace is the tool bar. To select a tool, click on it.
				Most tools have hotkeys that allow you to select them with the keyboard. Hovering the mouse over a tool displays
				its name and associated hotkey in brackets.
				<img src="images/help/toolbar.png"/>
				<p class="caption">
					The tool bar. Tools from top to bottom: Selection Tool, Line Tool, Arc Tool, Perspective Arc Tool, Bezier Tool, Marker Tool.
					The selection tool is currently selected.
				</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				Each tool is capable of performing an action or drawing a shape based on a series of steps (usually involving a mouse
				click). The number of steps involved varies from tool to
				tool, several of them having optional steps.
			</p>
			<p>
				All tools follow the same convention: the optional steps can be skipped
				by either pressing <b>enter</b>/<b>return</b>, or by <b>right-clicking</b> (which is equivalent to a 
				left-click followed by enter/return). This is referred to as <em>completing</em>
				the tool. You may revert to a previous step at any time prior to completing a tool by pressing the <b>escape</b> key. 
				Each tool is discussed in detail below with optional steps indicated by faded step numbers.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_line_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/line_tool_btn.png"/>Line Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The line tool draws lines aligned to points. It can be thought of as a straightedge.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click anywhere in the workspace to define a reference point.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to define a second reference point. The line will be drawn along the resulting path.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to place the beginning of your line.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to place the end of your line and complete the tool.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				During step 2, the <b>shift</b> key may be held down to constrain the line to angles of 45&deg;.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_arc_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/arc_tool_btn.png"/>Arc Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The arc tool draws circles and circular arcs. It can be thought of as a compass.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click anywhere in the workspace to place the center of the circular arc.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click elsewhere to set the radius of the arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to begin sweeping an arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click elsewhere to complete the arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Repeat steps 3-4 as desired, or press enter or right-click to complete the tool.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				During step 2, the <b>shift</b> key may be held down in order to match the last-used arc radius. This is crucial for
				many <a href="#nav_construction">geometric constructions</a>.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_parc_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/persp_arc_tool_btn.png"/>Perspective Arc Tool</h3>
			<p>
					The perspective arc tool draws arcs in perspective, thereby producing ellipses or elliptical arcs. This is
					useful for constructing arches, circular windows, etc. in perspective. When approaching such a problem
					by hand, one generally starts with a rectangle in perspective and then inscribes the ellipse in that 
					rectangle. The perspective arc tool operates on the same principle.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/inscribe.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				An ellipse projected in perspective.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click to place the first "corner" of the perspective projection.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the second corner.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the third corner.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the fourth corner. This creates the projected ellipse.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click to begin sweeping an arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Click elsewhere to complete the arc.</p></li>
				<li class="optional"><p>Repeat steps 5-6 as desired, or press enter or right-click to complete the tool.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In order to accurately place the corners of the ellipse projection, use Alberti's <a href="#nav_snap">auto-snap</a> feature.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_bez_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/bez_tool_btn.png"/>Bezier Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The bezier tool allows you to draw arbitrary curves. It can be thought of as a French curve.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click to place the beginning of the curve.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the end of the curve.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click to place the control point of the curve. This completes the curve.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				It is possible to accurately construct a curve in perspective by using <a href="#nav_snap">auto-snap</a> to place
				its control points.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/lancet.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				The ogive of a lancet window is constructed by placing the control points of its constituent curves at the 
				intersections of appropriate vanishing lines.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_sel_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/select_tool_btn.png"/>Selection Tool</h3>
			<p>
				The selection tool selects shapes. Once a shape is selected, it can be deleted by pressing <b>backspace</b> or
				<b>delete</b>, or by selecting <em>Edit > Delete</em> from the <a href="#nav_mm">main menu</a>. You can also
				<a href="#nav_cut_paste">cut</a> the shape by selecting <em>Edit > Cut</em>. Selections are indicated by
				dashed lines and black endpoint markers.
			</p>
			<img src="images/help/selection.gif"/>
			<p class="caption">
				An unselected shape (left) and a selected one (right).
			</p>
			<p>
				In Alberti, once a shape is created it cannot be modified, even when selected. This is admittedly unusual for a
				vector-based drawing program, but is by design. The idea is that each shape is like a mark made by a pencil;
				it can be erased, but not changed.
			</p>
			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><p>Click and hold the mouse button down.</p></li>
				<li><p>Drag the mouse to expand the selection box.</p></li>
				<li><p>Release the mouse button. Any shapes enclosed by or intersecting with the selection box will be selected.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				To add shapes to or remove shapes from an existing selection, simply hold down <b>shift</b> as you release the 
				mouse button 
				in step 3. Selected shapes within the selection box will be deselected while unselected shapes will become selected.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is possible to "pick" single shapes by simply clicking on a shape without dragging. You can also pick
				intersections using <a href="#nav_snap">auto-snap</a>. All shapes that intersect at the snap point will be
				selected.
			</p>
			<h3 id="nav_mark_tool"><img class="insert" src="images/marker_tool_btn.png"/>Marker Tool</h3>
			<p>
				Use the marker tool to place markers around the workspace. Markers are best placed at landmarks that you often
				frequent, such as vanishing points.
				<h4>Steps</h4>
				<ol>
					<li><p>Click anywhere in the workspace to place a marker.</p></li>
					<li><p>Cycle between markers at any time using the <a href="#nav_navbar">navigation bar</a> or associated hotkeys.</p></li>
				</ol>
