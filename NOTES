HARDWARE ACCELERATION of UNDERLAY IMAGES

Alberti's underlay image feature involves intensive image transformations and 
as such demands hardware acceleration. As of 7/2/2011, only WebKit-based 
browsers support CSS-based HW acceleration (via the 'translate3d' and 
'scale3d' -webkit-transform properties). The feature is still available in 
Mozilla browsers, though performance may be poor.
